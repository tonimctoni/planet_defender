Just a game. A simple, unremarkable game.

# TODO
    - Add more meteor types. Maybe come up with fancier mechanics than current ones have.
        - Maybe meteors that appear in certain patterns, like V shaped.
        - Maybe one deflects (some) projectiles, maybe increasing their speed, but in the oposite direction.

    - See if *energy meter flask* can be improved by adding some sort of border to it.
