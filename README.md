Just a game. A simple, unremarkable game.

# TODO

    - Make a projectile that behaves like a lazer. Tha is, it is fast and it is not destroyed on impact.

    - Add more meteor types. Maybe come up with fancier mechanics than current ones have.
        - Maybe some get bumped back when hit. Maybe this damages other meteors.
        - Maybe meteors that appear in certain patterns, like V shaped.
            - Make this a characteristic of `GameEvents`, and not of `Meteor`.

    - See if *energy meter flask* can be improved by adding some sort of border to it.

    - Definitely replace dummy projectile images with better ones.
